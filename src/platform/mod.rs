//! The platform registry: every 1C:Enterprise build ibcmd-rs knows, and what
//! each one implies for the XML it reads and writes and for the rows it
//! stores.
//!
//! One place answers "what does platform X do":
//!
//! - its XML format: 8.3.x reads and writes 2.20, 8.5.x 2.21
//!   ([`PlatformSpec::xml_version`]);
//! - the stored layout of its managed forms and of the colours and fonts of
//!   other rows: the 8.3 one, or the one 8.5.1 introduced
//!   ([`PlatformSpec::form_layout`]);
//! - the features a configuration saved by it may list in its `version` row,
//!   such as the 8.5.1 palette colours ([`PlatformSpec::features`]);
//! - whether direct MSSQL activation is evidenced for it
//!   ([`PlatformSpec::live_activation`]).
//!
//! The builds and what they declare live in `profiles/platform/*.json`: the
//! bundled profiles `profile_registry` compiles in, whose MSSQL write
//! capabilities `MssqlNativePlatformProfile` checks. This module reads the
//! same declarations -- the constants `platform.xml_format`,
//! `platform.form_layout` and `platform.feature.<name>` -- instead of
//! repeating them in code. A build whose profile declares no XML format (the
//! 8.3.24.1819 seed) is known but not supported.
//!
//! A platform is named by its full version: an exact build (`8.3.27.2214`)
//! or a release (`8.3.27`), which stands for every known build of it and
//! exists only while they agree on what they declare. A version the registry
//! does not know is refused with the list of known ones, never mapped to the
//! nearest one.
//!
//! # Naming, and what a new build needs
//!
//! Code that depends on the platform is named after the FULL version in which
//! its subject first appeared -- `mssql_dump/form/layout_8_5_1.rs`,
//! `FormFactsV8_5_1`, [`FormLayout::V8_5_1`] -- and code of an XML dialect
//! after the XML format (`mssql_dump/form/xml_2_21_writer.rs`), never after a
//! nickname such as "85". When a new build arrives, say 8.5.4:
//!
//! - nothing changed for ibcmd-rs: one registry entry,
//!   `profiles/platform/8.5.4.<build>.json` listed in
//!   `profile_registry::BUNDLED_PROFILES`, declaring the XML format, form
//!   layout and features it shares with 8.5.1;
//! - its stored layout changed: in addition a delta module
//!   `mssql_dump/form/layout_8_5_4.rs` (and `load_8_5_4.rs`) converting
//!   between it and the 8.5.1 layout, a `FormLayout::V8_5_4`, and the entry
//!   declares `"platform.form_layout": "8.5.4"`;
//! - its XML format changed (say to 2.22): `xml_2_22_*` modules, an
//!   `InfobaseConfigSourceVersion::V2_22`, and the entry declares
//!   `"platform.xml_format": "2.22"`.
