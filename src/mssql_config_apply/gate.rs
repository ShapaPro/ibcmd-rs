//! Refusing what needs a restructuring.
//!
//! The own apply moves rows; it does not change the database's structure.
//! Whether a staged configuration needs that is decided here, behind
//! [`StructuralGate`], so that the full check of the restructure-check track
//! (`check_staged`) can replace [`ConservativeGate`] at the one call site in
//! `plan`.
//!
//! The conservative rule admits exactly what the acceptance of #337 names and
//! nothing else:
//!
//! - the service rows `root` and `version` unchanged, `versions` replaced;
//! - a descriptor row that exists in `Config` and inflates to the same text
//!   (only the compression differs);
//! - a body row whose owner kind and suffix the source-asset registry names as
//!   a module, a form, a template, a picture or a help page.
//!
//! Every other change -- a descriptor whose text differs, a new object, a
//! predefined-data, rights, interface or package body, an unknown row name --
//! is a blocker.
