"""The files a `source-diff` report lists as not unchanged, against the ones that are expected to differ.

usage: python diff_paths.py <source-diff report.json> [<list of expected paths, one per line> [<export of our twin> <edited forms dir>]]
With the last two: the forms of our twin's export are also compared, byte for byte, with the edited forms that were imported.
The route through our import stages the whole tree, the forms without the fields bound to removed attributes (forms.txt of the case) among it;
the twin the platform staged with the descriptors only keeps the original forms. So the exports of the two differ in exactly those forms and in
`ConfigDumpInfo.xml` (the versions of the changed forms). Prints the differing paths and whether they are exactly the expected ones.
